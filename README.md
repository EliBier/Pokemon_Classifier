Hello and Welcome to the Repository for our Neural Networks Final Project. 
To begin start by downloading and extacting the kaggle dataset from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lantian773030/pokemonclassification
Next run the data_prep file on the dataset. Also make sure to rename the MrMime and Farfetchd folders to Mr.Mime and Farfetch'd.
Then you should be able to run either the type_classifer or who's_that_pokemon neural networks upon the dataset.
