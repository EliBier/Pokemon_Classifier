# Hello and Welcome to the repository for our Neural Networks Final Project. <br>
To begin start by downloading and extacting the kaggle dataset from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lantian773030/pokemonclassification <br>
Next Rename the MrMime and Farfetchd folders in the dataset to Mr.Mime and Farfetch'd. <br>
Finally, run the Data_Prep.py on the dataset folder. This will create two new folders labeled train_gen1 and test_gen1 inside of the folder structure which may need to be moved or the path to them adjusted in the Who's_That_Pokemon.py file <br>
Then you should be able to run either the type_classifer or who's_that_pokemon neural networks using the dataset. <br>

We have also included some files that contain the weights and biases that resulted after training our models.
